# Energy Sector Data Engineering Project - PySpark Transformation Scripts

 This project demonstrates the use of PySpark for transforming data in a cloud-based environment using Azure Databricks. The project is structured around a layered architecture consisting of raw, cleansed, and confirmed data layers.

This project is focused on the energy sector, where as a data engineer, I was responsible for generating data to speculate future energy demand. By utilizing PySpark's capabilities and Azure Databricks' scalability, we can efficiently process large datasets, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.
